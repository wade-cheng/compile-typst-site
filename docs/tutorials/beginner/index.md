# The beginner tutorial

This tutorial is for people who want to learn `compile-typst-site` by building a site from the ground-up. If you want a faster-paced introduction in the form of a list of actions to try on a sample site, look to [](../../how-to/quick_start.md).

This tutorial is a bit rough around the edges. Construction under way.
