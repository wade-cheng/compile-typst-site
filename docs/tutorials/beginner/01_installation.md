# Part 1: Installation

```{note}
This is a [tutorial](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials-how-to/) following some pretty standard software installation steps. If you have done this before, you may instead want [](../how-to/installation.md).
```

This tutorial section is unfinished. Here's a list of what we would want to go over, and what you might consider looking up if you're unfamiliar:

- general commmand line crash course
  - traversal (`cd`)
  - running commands (press enter/return after typing it out!)[^1]
  - current working directory and related concepts
- [installation](../how-to/installation.md) and uninstall

[^1]: Imagine it's like Minecraft and such.
