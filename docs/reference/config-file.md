# Config File API

The config file at `compile-typst-site.toml` is specified as such:

```rust
struct ConfigFile {
    /// Array of globs to match for passthrough-copying.
    ///
    /// Example in the TOML config file: `passthrough_copy = ["*.css", "*.js", "assets/*"]
    passthrough_copy: Option<Vec<String>>,
    /// Command to run before a full rebuild.
    ///
    /// E.g., `passthrough_copy = ["echo", "rebuilding"]`.
    init: Option<Vec<String>>,
    /// Command to run to post-process HTML files generated by Typst.
    ///
    /// Must take in stdin and return via stdout.
    ///
    /// Example in the TOML config file: `post_processing_typ = ["python", "post_processing_script.py"]`.
    post_processing_typ: Option<Vec<String>>,
    /// Convert paths literally instead of magically tranforming to index.html.
    ///
    /// i.e., ./content.typ goes to ./content.html instead of defaulting to ./content/index.html.
    ///
    /// Example in the TOML config file: `literal_paths = true`
    literal_paths: Option<bool>,
    /// Typst cannot yet glob-find multiple files, which is a problem if one wants to list, e.g., all blog posts on a page.
    /// To work around this, we write all Typst files(?) as a JSON to the project root directory.
    ///
    /// We also let you query for data. (You might want the dates of those blog posts to appear on your listing page).
    /// This is slower than the other options because we have to call `typst query`.
    ///
    /// Must be one of "disabled", "enabled", "include-data"
    ///
    /// Example in the TOML config file: `file_listing = "enabled"`
    file_listing: Option<String>,
}
```
