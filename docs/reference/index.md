# Reference

Nitty-gritty technical descriptions of how `compile-typst-site` works. Most useful when you
need detailed information about usage, requirements, and inner workings.

## Concepts

`compile-typst-site` expects to be called somewhere under the following directory structure:

```
.
├── src/
├── templates/
└── compile-typst-site.toml
```

That is, just like `cargo`, `just`, `uv`, and so on, you can use `compile-typst-site` while in a subdirectory of the project root.

The directory `.` (one that contains a `compile-typst-site.toml` file) is known as the "project root."

When you do so, it looks at every file in `src`. For each such file, one of the following happens:

- Typst files are compiled by calling your local Typst CLI; we expect one to be installed.
- Files matching those in the `passthrough_copy` array in `compile-typst-site.toml` are copied over. Matching can use globs, processed with the `globset` crate. This is probably unidiomatic to file paths (`*` matches recursively instead of just the first layer).
- Other files are ignored.

If file watching is turned on, changes in `src` will only recompile that file. Changes in `templates` will recompile the entire project (all of `src`). We aren't smart enough to detect exactly which dependents to recompile.

## Config File API

The configuration file at `compile-typst-site.toml` is specified as such:

```rust
struct ConfigFile {
    /// Array of globs to match for passthrough-copying.
    ///
    /// Example in the TOML config file: `passthrough_copy = ["*.css", "*.js", "assets/*"]
    passthrough_copy: Option<Vec<String>>,
    /// Command to run before a full rebuild.
    ///
    /// $PROJECT_ROOT is replaced with the path to the project root.
    ///
    /// E.g., `passthrough_copy = ["python", "$PROJECT_ROOT/prebuild.py"]`.
    init: Option<Vec<String>>,
    /// Command to run to post-process HTML files generated by Typst.
    ///
    /// Must take in stdin and return via stdout.
    ///
    /// $PROJECT_ROOT is replaced with the path to the project root.
    ///
    /// Example in the TOML config file: `post_processing_typ = ["python", "$PROJECT_ROOT/post_processing_script.py"]`.
    post_processing_typ: Option<Vec<String>>,
    /// Convert paths literally instead of magically tranforming to index.html.
    ///
    /// i.e., ./content.typ goes to ./content.html instead of defaulting to ./content/index.html.
    ///
    /// Example in the TOML config file: `literal_paths = true`
    literal_paths: Option<bool>,
    /// Typst cannot yet glob-find multiple files, which is a problem if one wants to list, e.g., all blog posts on a page.
    /// To work around this, we write all Typst files(?) as a JSON to the project root directory.
    ///
    /// We also let you query for data. (You might want the dates of those blog posts to appear on your listing page).
    /// This is slower than the other options because we have to call `typst query`.
    ///
    /// Must be one of "disabled", "enabled", "include-data"
    ///
    /// Example in the TOML config file: `file_listing = "enabled"`
    file_listing: Option<String>,
}
```
